# Portfolio

This repo showcases my work experience as a web3 security researcher. It includes contests on [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/) and [Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.xyz/), and potentially private audits in the future. Also, I will showcase achievements such as CTF and Secureum RACE ranking.
